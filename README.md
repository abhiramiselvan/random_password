# Random Password Generated
 
### Introduction

Embark on the challenge of crafting a random password generator application using Python, where the goal is to develop a Command Line Interface (CLI) Python script capable of producing a unique 12-character password each time the program is executed.

### Functionality

Upon each program execution, the generated password must adhere to the following criteria:

- #### Comprise 12 characters.
  - Include uppercase letters from A to Z.
  - Incorporate lowercase letters from a to z.
  - Contain digits ranging from 0 to 9.
  - Embrace symbols such as (!, ?, â€œ, #, etc).

- #### Functionality

Upon running the program, a random password is generated and displayed in the Command Prompt (CMD). With each successive execution, the program consistently produces distinct and varied passwords, encompassing a diverse range of characters.
